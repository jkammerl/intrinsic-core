References to the current platform release versions.
"nightly" refers to the latest release via the autopush rollout group.
"prod" refers to the latest release via the prod rollout group.

Usage of these references on the release branches is not recommended since
any change to these contents would require creating another release
candidate, thus rendering these references immediately stale. Instead use the
`semver` action, for example:
